# platformer
Made on Python and inspired by Mario. Includes a code to make levels, and another to play them.
You need to have python and pygame installed on your device.
Run platformer.py to play the game with my preset levels.
Run level_editor.py to edit the levels. Right now, you need to go into the code for level_editor and manually change which level you are editing.
You do this by changing the load and save variables to map1.json/map2.json/map3.json.
