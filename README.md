# platformer
You need to have python and pygame installed on your device. </br>
Run platformer.py to play the game with my preset levels. </br>
Run level_editor.py to edit the levels. Right now, you need to go into the code for level_editor and manually change which level you are editing. You do this by changing the load and save variables to map1.json/map2.json/map3.json. </br>
